For the final project in my Internet of Things course, I worked in a team to create a smart light system that allows the user to remotely control a LED bulb. My contribution to the project was mainly on the software side. 

## Hardware Design

The LED bulb, along with a photoresistor, was connected to a Raspberry Pi. The photoresistor was used to determine the ambient brightness of the room in order to adjust the LED brightness accordingly. Additionally, a transistor was used with the LED's battery pack as a relay in order to adjust the LED brightness using the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi. 

The design of the smart light includes a lamp modified to hold the 12V LED bulb that plugs into the box that holds the Raspberry Pi and breadboard circuits.

I used an Apache web server on the Raspberry Pi, HTML for the user interface, PHP to handle the HTML form input and call the appropriate Python scripts, and Python to control the LED (turn on/off, adjust brightness). 

## How the Smart Light Works
- User uses their device to connect to the Raspberry Pi via its IP address
- On the webpage, there is a HTML form that allows the user to select among the following options:
  - Choose among four brightness settings for the LED
  - Turn the LED off
  - Enable or disable auto brightness mode, in which the LED brightness is automatically determined by the ambient brightness in the room
- PHP script takes in the user input via HTTP and runs the appropriate Python script:
  - Turn LED on/ off: The "on" setting is the brightest LED setting. The "off" setting kills the currently running Python script.
  - Adjust brightness: Change the duty cycle of the PWM output (increase duty cycle to increase the brightness)
  - Auto brightness mode: Read input from photoresistor to determine amount of ambient light. Then increase the brightness when it is dark in the room and vice versa. 

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Photoresistor
- LED Bulb (12 V)
- 12V Battery Pack
- Transistor (12V MOSFET)
- 300Ω Resistor (Used with the transistor)
- 1µF Capacitor (Used as an analog to digital converter between the photoresistor and the Raspberry Pi)
